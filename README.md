Portfolio Optimization with Python

---------------
Introduction
---------------

This project was a submission to a DataCamp competition.  The purpose of this project was to understand the return profile of Bitcoin as an investment and compare it to the common investment instruments.

Using daily and monthly price data for Bitcoin (BTC), S&P 500 index and Gold this report will:

* compare historical monthly returns for all three assets from 2014 to 2021 to show that while BTC is a worthy investment, it is not a perfect hedge against inflation
* for BTC, in particular, anticipate price volatility around halving dates and model volatility profile using risk models
* develop scenarios for portfolios with minimum volatility (0% weighting to BTC) and maximum return (0% < weighting to BTC) using modern portfolio theory (MPT)
* explain the Mayer Multiple and examine it's use to determine the price trend of Bitcoin
